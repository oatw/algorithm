## Issues

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/oatw/algorithm/issues) is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting pull requests.

## Pull Requests

This repository follows the [Forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow). You need fork this repository before embarking pull requests. Only pull requests to the [develop](https://github.com/oatw/algorithm/blob/develop) branch will be merged. So a new branch based on the `develop` branch is needed when you're going to fix a bug or add a new feature.
