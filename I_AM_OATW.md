# I am Oatw

Well~ My Github session has been expired,
and I can't login through the web interface now...

Two-factor authentication is enabled on my Google account.
Unfortunately, I lost my phone and I can't login to Gmail.

What's worse, my Gmail is the primary email associated with my Github account,
so I can't get the device verification code to login to Github either.

I've already contacted Github Support, and the ticket ID is **1056881**.

I'm not used to access to Github repos with ssh keys, normally I use password.
So I can't prove I'm oatw by providing the output of executing
`ssh -T git@github.com verify`.

Fortunately, I can still push codes to my Github repos,
so I created this branch to prove I'm oatw.
