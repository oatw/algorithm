# I am Oatw

Well~ My github session is expired, and I can't login now...

Two-factor authentication is enabled on my google account. Unfortunately,
I lost my phone and I can't login to gmail.

What's worse, my gmail is the primary email associated with my github account,
and I can't get the device verification code to login to github either.

I'm not used to access to my github repos with ssh keys, normally I use password.
So I can't prove I'm oatw by providing the output of executing
`ssh -T git@github.com verify`.

Fortunately, I can still push codes to my github repos,
so I created this branch to prove I'm oatw.
